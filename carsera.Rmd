## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(mtcars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

# Appendix 1
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(mtcars, aes(mpg, am, fill=cyl, size=hp)) +
    geom_point()

pairs(mtcars, panel=panel.smooth,col=3+mtcars$am)

summary(lm(mpg ~ . , data = mtcars))
summary(lm(mpg ~ am , data = mtcars))
```
